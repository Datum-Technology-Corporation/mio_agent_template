> Virtual Sequences for programmable error injection and error detection will soon be commercially available from [Datum](https://datumtc.ca/).

All protocol options, along with all bus widths, are configurable in simulation via constrained-random `cfg` object handles.

In addition, it can operate in 'Transport' mode where the Virtual Sequencer receives Sequence Items from an upstream Sequencer. On the flip side, it can operate in `bypass` mode, where the Virtual Interface (`vif`) is ignored and the Agent can be used to drive another Agent which is in 'Transport' mode.
